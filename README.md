### Main Components

#### Timeline.js

- Manages global state (zoom, pan, editing)
- Calculates positions and dimensions based on dates
- Renders time scale and lanes
- Implements zoom and navigation controls

#### TimelineItem.js

- Renders each individual timeline item
- Manages editing and drag states
- Displays event information (name, duration, dates)

#### assignLanes.js

- **Main Algorithm**: Implements a sweep line approach to optimize assignment
- **Alternative Algorithm**: Version that prioritizes minimizing gaps between events
- Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n \* m) for assignment, where m is the number of lanes

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Inspiration and References

- **Gantt Charts**: Based on project management tools like Asana and Monday.com
- **GitHub Timeline**: Inspired by commit and release visualizations
- **Material Design**: Following elevation and visual hierarchy principles

### Color Palette

- **Main Gradient**: Blue to purple (#667eea → #764ba2) for a modern look
- **Contrast**: White background with colored elements for maximum readability
- **States**: Hover effects and smooth transitions for better UX

### Typography

- **System Font Stack**: Uses native system fonts for performance and familiarity
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Different sizes for title, subtitle, and content
- **Readability**: Adequate spacing between elements

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Lane Algorithm

```javascript
// Sweep line approach to optimize assignment
for (const item of sortedItems) {
  let assignedLane = -1;

  // Find available lane
  for (let i = 0; i < laneEnds.length; i++) {
    if (laneEnds[i] <= item.startDate) {
      assignedLane = i;
      break;
    }
  }

  // Create new lane if necessary
  if (assignedLane === -1) {
    assignedLane = lanes.length;
    lanes.push([]);
    laneEnds.push(item.endDate);
  }

  lanes[assignedLane].push(item);
}
```

### Zoom System

- **Base Scale**: 100px per day
- **Limits**: 30% (30px/day) to 300% (300px/day)
- **Increment**: 20% per click
- **Persistence**: State maintained during session

### Responsiveness

- **Breakpoints**: 768px for mobile devices
- **Adaptation**: Controls reorganize on smaller screens
- **Touch**: Prepared for touch interactions (can be expanded)

## 💭 What I Like About This Implementation

### Algorithm Efficiency

The lane assignment algorithm efficiently handles overlapping events using a sweep line approach, ensuring optimal space utilization while maintaining O(n log n) complexity for sorting and O(n \* m) for lane assignment.

### User Experience

The zoom and pan functionality provides intuitive navigation through long timelines, while the inline editing allows quick modifications without modal dialogs. The reset button ensures users can easily return to the initial state.

### Code Structure

The component architecture separates concerns well - Timeline.js handles global state and calculations, TimelineItem.js manages individual item rendering and interactions, and assignLanes.js provides a clean, testable algorithm.

### Responsive Design

The implementation gracefully handles different screen sizes, reorganizing controls and maintaining usability across devices.

## 🔄 What I Would Change If I Did It Again

### Performance Optimizations

- Implement React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Add virtualization for timelines with hundreds of items
- Use CSS transforms instead of changing left/top properties for smoother animations

### State Management

- Consider using useReducer for complex state logic instead of multiple useState calls
- Implement proper undo/redo functionality with a command pattern
- Add persistence of user preferences (zoom level, pan position)

### Accessibility

- Add proper ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- Implement keyboard navigation (arrow keys for zoom, space for pan)
- Add focus management for inline editing

### Error Handling

- Add proper error boundaries for component failures
- Validate date inputs and provide user feedback
- Handle edge cases like invalid date ranges

## 🎯 How I Made Design Decisions

### Research Phase

I studied existing timeline implementations from:

- **Asana's project timeline**: For lane organization and visual hierarchy
- **Monday.com's Gantt charts**: For zoom and pan interactions
- **GitHub's commit timeline**: For compact, information-dense layouts
- **Trello's timeline view**: For drag and drop patterns

### Design Principles

- **Information Density**: Maximize visible information while maintaining readability
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential info first, details on interaction
- **Consistent Interaction**: Zoom, pan, and edit follow established UX patterns
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use color, size, and spacing to guide user attention

### Technical Constraints

- **Performance**: Chose algorithms that scale well with data size
- **Maintainability**: Separated concerns into focused, testable modules
- **Extensibility**: Structured code to easily add features like filtering or export

## 🧪 How I Would Test This With More Time

### Unit Testing (Priority 1)

```javascript
// Test lane assignment algorithm edge cases
describe("assignLanes edge cases", () => {
  test("handles single-day events", () => {});
  test("handles events with same start/end dates", () => {});
  test("handles overlapping events with different durations", () => {});
  test("handles events spanning multiple months", () => {});
});

// Test zoom and pan calculations
describe("timeline calculations", () => {
  test("zoom calculations maintain center point", () => {});
  test("pan boundaries are respected", () => {});
  test("date-to-pixel conversions are accurate", () => {});
});
```

### Integration Testing (Priority 2)

- **Component Interaction**: Test zoom state affects item positioning
- **Data Flow**: Verify timeline updates when items change
- **Responsive Behavior**: Test breakpoints and mobile interactions
- **State Persistence**: Verify zoom/pan state during component updates

### E2E Testing (Priority 3)

- **User Workflows**: Complete timeline exploration and editing flows
- **Cross-browser**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Performance**: Measure render times with 100+ timeline items
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader navigation and keyboard-only usage

### Performance Testing

- **Load Testing**: Timeline with 1000+ items
- **Memory Profiling**: Check for memory leaks during long sessions
- **Animation Performance**: Ensure 60fps during zoom/pan operations
- **Bundle Analysis**: Optimize bundle size and loading performance

## 🔮 Future Improvements

2. **Filters**: By period, category, or name
3. **Export**: PDF, PNG, or structured data
4. **Undo/Redo**: Change history
